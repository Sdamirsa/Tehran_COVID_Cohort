# Epidemiology of COVID-19 Inpatients

> ✔ OPEN SCIENCE

This page contains code, details, and data (coming soon) of a multicentric research project on the epidemiology of COVID-19 inpatients. 
Patient registry was retrieved from medical records and hospital information systems retrospectively, followed by a follow-up call to identify post-COVID symptoms and complications.

## Project Details

### Data Sources:
* Phase I Registry (2019-2020): Emam Hossein Hospital, Taleghani Hospital, Shohada-E-Tajrish Hospital
* Phase II (2021-2022): Emam Hossein Hospital, Loghman Hospital

### Research Team:
* Principal Investigator: Dr. Mohamad Amin Pourhoseingholi, PhD (Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases; aminphg@gmail.com)
* Coordinator: Dr. Seyed Amir Ahmad Safavi-Naini, MD (Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases; sdamirsa@gmail.com)

### Ethics:
* Ethical ID: [IR.SBMU.RIGLD.REC.1399.058](https://ethics.research.ac.ir/EthicsProposalView.php?id=168337)

### Research Center:
* [Basic and Molecular Epidemiology Research Center](https://sbmu.ac.ir/index.jsp?siteid=137)
