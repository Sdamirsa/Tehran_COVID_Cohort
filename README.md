# Epidemiology of COVID-19 inpatients 
> âœ” OPEN SCIENCE 
This page contains code, detail, and data (in the near future) of a multicentric research project on epidemiology of COVID-19 inpatients. 
Patient registry was retrived from medical records and hospital information systemst retrospectivly, and then, a follow-up call was made to find post-COVID symptoms and complications.

### Detail of project: 
Data source: 
* Phase I Registry (2019-2020): Emam Hossein Hospital, Taleghani Hospital, Shohada-E-Tajrish Hospital
* Phase II (2021-2022): Emam Hossein Hospital, Loghman Hospital
* Principal Investigator: Dr. Mohamad Amin Pourhoseingholi, PhD (Research Institute for Gastroentrology and Liver Diseases; aminphg@gmail.com)
* Coordinator: Dr. Seyed Amir Ahmad Safavi-Naini, MD (Research Institute for Gastroentrology and Liver Diseases; sdamirsa@gmail.com)
* Ethical ID: [IR.SBMU.RIGLD.REC.1399.058](https://ethics.research.ac.ir/EthicsProposalView.php?id=168337)
* Lab: [Basic and Molecular Epidemiology Research Cencter](https://sbmu.ac.ir/index.jsp?siteid=137)
